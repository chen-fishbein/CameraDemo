The camera demo shows off the [Capture API](https://www.codenameone.com/manual/misc-features.html#_capture_photos_video_audio) allowing us to grab a photo to display to the user. 

You can learn more about the capture API by checking out the [JavaDocs for Capture](https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/capture/Capture.html) and the [developer guide](https://www.codenameone.com/manual/) ([pdf](https://www.codenameone.com/files/developer-guide.pdf)).

You can try the native demo on an Android device [here](https://www.codenameone.com/demos-Camera.html) and also check out the live [in browser version of the demo](https://www.codenameone.com/demos/CameraDemo/). The latter uses the [Codename One JavaScript port](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/javascript-port.html) to build the unmodified demo into a web app.
